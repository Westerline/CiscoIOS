! To create an IP Nat Pool:
IP NAT Pool
    ! <Name> <Start Address> <End Address> <"Netmask"> <Subnet Address>

IP NAT
    ! <Inside/Outside> <"Source"> <"Static" + IP Address/"List" + ACL Identifier> <IP Address/Pool> <Overload>

Interface <Interface>
    IP NAT <Inside/Outside>

! Example: tells the router to translate IP addresses that match access-list 1 to the IP address pool "Todd" using overload.
IP NAT Pool Todd 170.168.2.1 170.168.2.1 NetMask 255.255.255.0
Access-List 1 Permit 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255
IP NAT Inside Source List 1 Pool Todd Overload
Interface Ethernet 0/0
IP Address 10.1.1.10 255.255.255.0
IP NAT Inside
Interface Serial 0/0
IP Address 170.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
IP NAT Outside
